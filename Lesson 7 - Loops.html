    //Loops

    //Repeating Tasks Manually

    //It is super time consuming to type out the same code every single time if an action is needed to be repeated.

    //The For Loop

    //Includes iterator variable that appears in all three expressions.

    //Iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration.

    //Iterator variables have any name, but its best practice to use a descriptive variable name.

    //For loop contains three expressions seperated by ; inside the parentheses.

    //1.An initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.

    //2.Stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against, if the condition is true, the code block will run but if its false the code will stop.

    //3.An iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.

    for(let counter = 5; counter <=10;counter++){

        console.log(counter);
    }

    //Looping in Reverse

    // The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
    for (let counter = 3; counter >=0; counter--){
        console.log(counter);
    }

    //Looping through Arrays

    //Loops are handy for looping through arrays, and the iterator variable is usually an i, which stands for index.

    const vacationSpots2 = ['Bali', 'Paris', 'Tulum'];

    for(let i = 0; i < vacationSpots2.length; i++){
        console.log("I would love to visit "+ vacationSpots2[i]);

    }

    //Nested Loops

    //If we have a loop running inside another loop its called a nested loop.

    //We use for loops to compare the elements in two arrays. For each round of the outer for loop, the inner for loop will run completely.

    let bobsFollowers = ["Jeyason","Kian","Dhiaa","Jerry"];

    let tinasFollowers = ["Jeyason","Kian","Julie"];

    let mutualFollowers = [];

    for(let i = 0; i < bobsFollowers.length;i++){
    let followerOne = bobsFollowers[i];

            let followerTwo = tinasFollowers[j];

            if(followerOne === followerTwo){
                mutualFollowers.push(followerOne);
            }
        }
    }

    //The While Loop

    //Syntax for a for loop is ideal when we know how many times the loop should run but for a while loop, when we want a loop to execute an undetermined # of times, while loops are the best choice.

    const cards = ['diamond', 'spade', 'heart', 'club'];

    let currentCard;

    while (currentCard !== "spade"){
        currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random()*4)];
        console.log(currentCard);

    }

    //do while statements

    //If I want a piece of code to run at least once and then that loop is based on a specific condition after its initial run, the do- while statement comes in.

    const cupsOfSugarNeeded = 5;

    let cupsAdded = 0;

    //We have a sweet tooth, so we want to add at least one cup of sugar to the batter even if the value of cupsOfSugarNeeded is 0.
    do{
        cupsAdded = cupsAdded+1;

    }while(cupsAdded < cupsOfSugarNeeded);

    //Break keyword

    //The break keyword allows programs to break out of the loop from within the loop's block.
    //They are helpful when we are looping through large data structures! With breaks, we could add test conditions besides the stopping condition and exit the loop when they're met.
