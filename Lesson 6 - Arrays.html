    //Array

    //By: Jeyason Jeyaparan

    //Creating an Array

    //One way we could create an array is to use an array literal using square brackets.

    const hobbies = ["Coding","Running","Playing Games"];

    console.log(hobbies);

    //Accessing Elements

    //Arrays are zero-indexed meaning that the positions start counting from 0 instead of 1.

    //We could access individual items in the array using their index.

    const famousSayings = ['Fortune favors the brave.', 'A joke is a very serious thing.', 'Where there is love there is life.'];

    let listItem = famousSayings[0];

    console.log(famousSayings[2]);

    //Undefined is logged to the console.
    console.log(famousSayings[3]);

    //Update Elements

    //Once I have access to an element in an array I could update its value.

    let groceryList = ['bread', 'tomatoes', 'milk'];
    groceryList[1] = "avocados";

    //Arrays with let and const

    //We could change the contents of a const array but cannot reassign a new array or a different value.

    let condiments = ['Ketchup', 'Mustard', 'Soy Sauce', 'Sriracha'];

    const utensils = ['Fork', 'Knife', 'Chopsticks', 'Spork'];

    condiments[0] = "Mayo";

    console.log(condiments);

    condiments = [condiments[0]];

    //I could re-assign elements in an array and re-assign the entire new array to variable using the let keyword.
    console.log(condiments);

    utensils[3] = "Spoon";

    //I cannot re-assign the entire new array to variable using the const keyword, but I could change the values in the array.

    //This causes an error
    //utensils = [utensils[3]];

    console.log(utensils);

    //.length property

    //One of array's built in properties is length and it returns number of items in the array.

    const objectives = ['Learn a new languages', 'Read 52 books', 'Run a marathon'];
    console.log(objectives.length);

    //.push() Method

    //.push() allows us to add items to the end of an array.

    const chores = ['wash dishes', 'do laundry', 'take out trash'];

    chores.push("work on coding");
    chores.push("eat food");

    console.log(chores);

    //.pop() method.

    //This method removes the last item of an array.

    const chores2 = ['wash dishes', 'do laundry', 'take out trash', 'cook dinner', 'mop floor'];

    chores2.pop();
    console.log(chores2);

    //More Array methods.

    //I could read more about the array methods that exist on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) array documentation.

    //Some array methods that are avaliable to developers include, join(), slice(), splice(), shift(), unshift(), concat().

    const groceryList2 = ['orange juice', 'bananas', 'coffee beans', 'brown rice', 'pasta', 'coconut oil', 'plantains'];

    groceryList2.shift();
    console.log(groceryList2);

    groceryList.unshift("popcorn");
    console.log(groceryList2);

    console.log(groceryList2.slice(1,4));

    console.log(groceryList2);

    const pastaIndex = groceryList2.indexOf("pasta");

    console.log(pastaIndex);

    //Arrays and Functions

    //.push() method mutates or changes an array.

    //When you pass an array into a function, if the array is mutated inside the function, that change will be maintained outside the function as well.

    //Concept is explained as a pass by reference as well since what we're actually passing the function is a reference to where the variable memory is stored and changing the memory.

    const concept = ['arrays', 'can', 'be', 'mutated'];

    function changeArr(arr){
    arr[3] = 'MUTATED';
    }

    changeArr(concept);

    console.log(concept);

    const removeElement = (newArr) => newArr.pop();

    removeElement(concept);

    console.log(concept);

    //In both cases, the change to the array was maintained outside of the function.

    //Nested Array

    //Arrays could store other arrays, so when an array contains another array its called a nested array.

    const numberClusters = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]];
    const target = numberClusters[2][1];
