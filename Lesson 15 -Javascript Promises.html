    //Javascript Promises

    //What is a Promise?

    //Promises are objects that represent the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation.
    //A Promise object can be in one of the three states:

    //Pending: The initial stateâ€” the operation has not completed yet.

    //Fulfilled: The operation has completed successfully and the promise now has a resolved value.

    //Rejected: The operation has failed and the promise has a reason for failure.

    //Constructing a Promise object.

    //To create a new Promise object, we use the new keyword and the Promise constructor method.

/*     const inventory = {
        sunglasses: 1000,
        pants: 1088,
        bags: 1344
    };

    // Write your code below:
    function myExecutor(resolve,reject){
        if(inventory.sunglasses > 0){
            resolve('Sunglasses order processed.');
        }
        else{
            reject('That item is sold out.');
        }
    }
    const orderSunglasses = () =>{
        let promise = new Promise(myExecutor);
        return promise;
    }

    let orderPromise = orderSunglasses();

    console.log(orderPromise);

(node:54) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): That item is sold out.
(node:54) DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code. */

//The Node setTimeout() Function

//Knowing how to construct a promise is useful but knowing how to use promises are key.

//I'm going to be Handling Promise objects returned to me as the result of an asynchronous operation instead of constructing promises.

//setTimeout() is a Node API that uses callback functions to schedule tasks to be performed after a delay.

//setTimeout() has two parameters a callback function and a delay in milliseconds.
