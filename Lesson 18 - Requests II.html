    //Requests II

    //The first type of requests we're going to tackle are GET requests using fetch().

    //The fetch function creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.

    //Sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.

    //Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to response object, which contains the status of the promise with info the API sent back.

    //fetch() GET Requests II

    //We are going to reconstruct the boilerplate code neccessary to create a GET request using the fetch() function step by step.

    fetch('https://api-to-call.com/endpoint').then((response) =>{

        if(response.ok === true){
            return response.json();
        }

        throw new Error('Request failed!');

    },(networkError) =>{
        console.log(networkError.message);
    }).then((jsonResponse) =>{
