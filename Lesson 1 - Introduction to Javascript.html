    /*The console is a panel that displays important messages like ferrors for developers. 
    Much of the work the computer does with our code
    is invisible to us by default. If we want to see things appear on our screen we could print or
    log to our console directly.

    In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions
    that we could use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language so the computer
    recogonizes them and treats them specially.

    The semicolon denotes the end of the line, or statement.

    We could use console.log() to print many different kinds of data.

   //Data types

   //In JavaScript there are seven fundemental data types:

   //Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4,8,1516,23.42

   //String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard(letters,numbers,spaces,symbols, etc.)
   //Surrounded by single quotes or double quotes. Though we prefer single quotes, some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.

   //Boolean: This data type only has two possible values, either true or false, its helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches to answers to a "yes" or "no" question.

   //Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value and is represented by the keyword null.

   //Undefined data type represents the absence of a value, but it has a different use than null.

   //Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols use unique identifers, useful in more complex coding.

   //Object: Collections of related data.

   //The first 6 of those types are considered to be primitive data types. They are the most basic data types in the language, but objects are more complex.

   //Logging a string
   console.log("JavaScript");

   //Logging a number

   //String Concatenation is when you use + to add strings.

   //Example add 'Hello' and 'World' together
   console.log("Hello"+"World");

   //Now add these two words but with a space betweeen them.
   console.log("Hello"+" "+"World");

   //When you introduce a new piece of data into Javascript, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type.
   //Every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in that string.

   //Javascript provides a number of different string methods.

   //Built- in Objects

   //There are objects that are built into JavaScript
   //For example, if I wanted to perform more complex mathematical operations, I could use the built-in Math object.

   //There is Math.random that generates a number between 0 and 1.
   //We then multiply that number by 50 so we have a number between 0 and 50.
   //We then use Math.floor() which rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.

   console.log(Math.random()*100);
   console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()*100));
