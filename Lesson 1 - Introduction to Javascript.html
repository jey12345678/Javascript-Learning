/*The console is a panel that displays important messages like ferrors for developers. 
Much of the work the computer does with our code
is invisible to us by default. If we want to see things appear on our screen we could print or
log to our console directly.

In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions
that we could use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language so the computer
recogonizes them and treats them specially.

The semicolon denotes the end of the line, or statement.

We could use console.log() to print many different kinds of data.
