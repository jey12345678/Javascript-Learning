    //Scope

    //By: Jeyason Jeyaparan

    //Blocks and Scope

    //A block, is the code found in a set of curly braces.{}
    //Helps us to group information together.

    const city = "New York City";

    function logCitySkyline(){

        let skyscraper = "Empire State Building";
        return "The stars over the "+skyscraper+" in "+ city;
    

    }

    //The function is able to access both variables inside and outside the function without any problems.
    console.log(logCitySkyline());

    //Global Scope

    //Scope is the context in which our variables are declared. We think of scope in relation to blocks because variables could exist either outside of or within the blocks.

    //In global scope, variables are declared outside of the blocks, and they are called global variables.
    //This is because they can be accessed by any code in the program including the code in the blocks.

    let satellite = "The Moon";
    let galaxy = "The Milky Way";
    let stars = "North Star";

    function callMyNightSky(){
        return "Night Sky: "+satellite+", "+stars+", and "+galaxy;
    }

    //Function block for callMyNightSky() is able to access the global variables because the variables are avaliable to all lines of the code in the file.

    console.log(callMyNightSky());

    //Block Scope

    //When a variable is defined inside of a block it is only accessible within the curly braces which is {}.

    //We say that the variable has a block scope because its only accessible to the lines of code within that block.

    //Variables that are declared with block scope are known as scope variables because they are only available to the code part of the same block.

    const logVisibleLightWaves = function(){
        const lightWaves = "Moonlight";
        console.log(lightWaves);
    }

    logVisibleLightWaves();

    //Causes error because the variable lightWaves is tied to the block scope of the function.
    //console.log(lightWaves);

    //Scope Pollution

    //Having too many global variables could cause problems within a program.

    //Scope pollution is when we have too many global variables that exist in the global namespace or when we reuse variables across different scopes.
    //Makes it difficult to keep track of our different vairables and sets us up for potential accidents.
    //Best practice to not define variables in the global scope.

    //Bad Coding Practice

    const satellite2 = 'The Moon';
    const galaxy2 = 'The Milky Way';
    let stars2 = 'North Star';

    const callMyNightSky2 = () => {

    stars = "Sirius";
    
        return 'Night Sky: ' + satellite2 + ', ' + stars2 + ', ' + galaxy2;
    };

    console.log(callMyNightSky2());
    console.log(stars2);

    //Practice Good Scoping

    //Tightly scoping my variables will improve my code by making it more legible as my code is organized into discrete sections.
    //Makes my code more understandable since it clarifies which variables are associated with different parts of the program rather than having me or someone else keeping track of my variables in every line.

    //Easier to maintain my code as its modular.
    //Saves memory in my code since the variable doesn't exist after the block is done running.

    const logVisibleLightWaves2 = () => {
        let lightWaves = 'Moonlight';
        let region = 'The Arctic';
        // Add if statement here:
        if(region === "The Arctic"){
            let lightWaves = "Northern Lights";

        //Inside the if block, console.log(lightWaves) logs the value of Northern Lights to the console.
        console.log(lightWaves);
    }
    
    //Outside the if block the same statement logs Moonlight to the console, so this way my code is more readable and understandable.
    console.log(lightWaves);
    };

    logVisibleLightWaves2();
